# Flightpriceprediction
implemented a flightprice predictor that creates a flask microframework. Uses a RandomForestregressor in order to make predictions based on the features.

Gathered the dataset for prices of flight tickets for various airlines - used two datasets, Train data and Test data - Training data is combination of both categorical and numerical also we can see some special character also being used because of which we have to do data Transformation on it before applying it to our model - predict the air tickets prices, and the performance of the models is compared to each other

There are two possible alternatives for handling the problem of airfare pricing prediction. The first approach tackles the prediction of air tickets prices as a regression problem, while the second one transforms it to a classification task

Purpose of this study is to better analyze the features that affect airfare and develop and tune models to predict the airfare well in advance.
